#  Hello Sir, welcome to my first Lab for the course of data lake

=> The goal of this lab is to import all the files in an azure data lake storage

# IMPORTANT
# I can't use Azure Data Lake storage because I've run out of student loans. So I can't create resources**


# Install the required packages: 
pip install azure-storage-file-datalake

pip install requests

pip install googledrivedownloader


# Replace
Replace <your_account_name> with the name of your Azure Data Lake Storage account in the account_name variable.

Replace <your_account_key> with the access key for your Azure Data Lake Storage account in the account_key variable.

Replace <your_file_system_name> with the name of the Azure Data Lake Storage file system you want to use in the file_system_name variable.
